# Adobe Target Python SDK

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/adobe/target-python-sdk/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/adobe/target-python-sdk?branch=main)

### Requirements
All currently maintained versions of Python are supported, see [Python Releases](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Older Python releases may likely work too, but are not officially supported.
```
NPM 6+ (required by openapi-generator-cli)
Java 8+ (required by openapi-generator)
GNU Make
```

### Set PYTHON_PATH

Various build commands are supported via Makefile, but first you must export environment variable PYTHON_PATH to specify which python install to use to set up your virtual env.

```bash
$ export PYTHON_PATH=python2.7  # Symlink to Mac OS built-in version of python
$ export PYTHON_PATH=/usr/local/bin/python3
```

### Setup virtual env to make it easy to switch between python 2.7 and 3

```bash
$ make new_env          # Deletes existing virtual env and creates new one based on PYTHON_PATH
$ make install          # Install dependencies in virtual env
```

### Code generation

The SDK depends on [Target Open API](https://github.com/adobe/target-openapi). It uses Open API and the `Open API generator` to generate the low level HTTP client.

To be able to use `Target Open API` for code generation, we are leveraging Git subtree.

To import `Target Open API` as `openapi` folder please use commands:

```bash
$ git subtree add --prefix openapi git@github.com:adobe/target-openapi.git main --squash
```

To refresh the imported subtree use this command:

```bash
$ git subtree pull --prefix openapi git@github.com:adobe/target-openapi.git main --squash
```

Once all the tools are installed, there is no need to invoke them directly, everything is wrapped in a `Makefile` command, which can be invoked by running:

```bash
$ make codegen
```

However, there are some deviations from the other SDKs, in which a manual code change is needed:
- user agent parsing does not match for the Mac OS X operating system

### Run tests and format code

```bash
$ make test
$ make format
```

### Release build package

Releases are triggered through Github publish workflow. Input version part to update before publishing to pypi - [patch, minor, major]

#### Running Github Workflows on forked repositories

Github Workflows don't run on forked repositories by default.
You must enable GitHub Actions in the Actions tab of the forked repository.
